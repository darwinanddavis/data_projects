# A snapshot of my data science projects   

Data are fickle beasts. They're a myriad of shapes and sizes, chaotic in their natural raw form, and often stubborn and disobedient. Despite their unfriendly nature, we need them, as they are keys to nature’s mysteries. As scientists, we’re very good at capturing them, cracking them open, and rummaging around to get what we need. However, merely operating is not enough. We need the right sets of tools and insight to extract pieces that tell the best story. This makes good data analysis equal parts art and science. 
The art comes from finding creative ways to make complex data compelling. The science is applying technical know-how to turn the excavated pieces into output. My selected projects present a range of data and problem sets that blend the creative and technical elements of my data analysis. The tabs in the page header contain a snapshot of each project, including collaborators, the aims, outcomes, and example outputs of my data analysis, and links to downloadable files and the project’s online home. As well as showcasing my data analysis in both independent and collaborative spaces, the projects highlight three crucial elements driving my interests as a data scientist.

First, I’m most comfortable using modelling insight and a computational lens to crack a problem. Tapping into my background as a modeller and computational scientist brings insight from diverse fields, such as math and computer science. The [Meta-analysis](meta) project highlights this well. In this 13-person project across 9 institutions, we conducted a meta-analysis on how disease burden that compromises metabolic growth and reproduction of roaming animals, both wild and livestock, impacts biomass recycling at a landscape scale. The project involved many hands on deck, but integral to the overall aim was including a model to bolster the larger idea with computational methods. The result was a disease transmission model using host energetics to track how infected roaming and herding animals can shift supply and turnover rates of nutrient input in landscapes. The delight for me in this project came from being able to fill some of the technical gaps in the group, of which many members were more field and lab trained. This underlines the value of applying computational approaches typical of data scientists to tackle unique problems and provide often necessary analytical expertise in collaborations.  

In the [Meta-analysis](meta) project, I also used my experience in data mining and wrangling to design a keyword query bot and a data scraper bot to bear some of the weight of data extraction and streamline efficiency for the group. This is a nice example of exploiting data analytics to improve workflow and enhance output to meet group deadlines and help complete a larger research project. The project page has a detailed rundown and user instructions and downloadable open source links to the bots.

Second, a major reason I enjoy data analytics is the diversity of data types and systems I work on. This cultivates new ways of problem solving and plays to my strength of switching among projects. Here are two project examples where I use a wide spectrum of data types and analyses.    

In the [Spatial](spatial) project, we built an individual-based simulation model integrating weather and microclimate data with Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) habitat data to forecast dispersal potential of animals in space and time. The model then used GPS telemetry data of animal locations to predict species occurrence under habitat change. The project involved mining messy data, diagnosing missing data, spatial and population modelling, integrating theory into model frameworks, and data presentation. The point is I was able to borrow from familiar methods, such as mining geocode data, and apply novel ones, such as spatial modelling, to an ecology problem combining a wide range of technical data. The project also taught me how to overcome the many technical obstacles of data analysis. For example, creating reproducible workflows for combining and analysing a variety of data was crucial to connecting all the intricate layers of the project.
