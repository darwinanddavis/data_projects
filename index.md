# A snapshot of my data science projects   

Data are fickle beasts. They're a myriad of shapes and sizes, chaotic in their natural raw form, and often stubborn and disobedient. Despite their unfriendly nature, we need them, as they are keys to nature’s mysteries. As scientists, we’re very good at capturing them, cracking them open, and rummaging around to get what we need. However, merely operating is not enough. We need the right sets of tools to extract pieces that tell the best story. This makes good data analysis equal parts art and science.  

The art comes from finding creative ways to make complex data compelling. The science is applying technical know-how to turn the excavated pieces into output. My selected projects present a range of data and problem sets that blend the creative and technical aspects of my computational work. The tabs in the page header have a snapshot of each project, including collaborators, the aims, outcomes, and example outputs of my data analysis, and links to downloadable files and the project’s online home. In addition to showcasing my skills and experience in data analysis in both independent and collaborative spaces, the projects highlight three crucial elements driving my interests as a data scientist.  

When old solutions reach their expiry date, it’s time to forge your own. Increasingly better computational methods, such as high performance computing and improved data pipelines, opens doors for better tools. I leverage these advances to develop sophisticated models exploring both classic and new problems. A good example is the [Disease](disease) project. The problem is well understood: Improve our understanding of how host-parasite ecology translates to human health risk. Our solution is novel by using theory-driven simulation models with detailed knowledge of host population structure and their resource use. This how their external environment shapes host-parasite physiology and energetics and eventually translates to human health risk. Similar ideas are now emerging in different systems, such as using human physiology data to understand susceptibility to seasonal diseases.
