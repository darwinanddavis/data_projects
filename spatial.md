## Simulating animal movement and dispersal potential in space and time from individual bioenergetics and habitat data          

### Location

Emory University Atlanta, USA

### People

**Matt Malishev, Emory University, USA**  
Michael Kearney, University of Melbourne, Australia  
C. Michael Bull, Flinders University, Australia    
  
### Tasks

* Develop a simulation model forecasting animal movement and dispersal potential in space and time using weather, microclimate, LIDAR, and geolocation data.   
* Integrate metabolic theory into simulation model.
